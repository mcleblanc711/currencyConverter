Personal project building a currency converter in Javascript. Uses Frankfurter
for exchange rates. Thanks to
https://dev.to/stackfindover/how-to-create-currency-converter-in-javascript-3h26
for helping me get started. I learned about utilizing public APIs, and next
update plan to include historical time rates.
Planning to use datepicker in next version.
